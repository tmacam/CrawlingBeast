/**Java-like iterator that merges the content of several runs.
 *
 * We really intended to make this a C++-like iterator (like most of the other
 * iterators in this project) but we just run out of patience. See 
 * http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq12-qt4-iterators.html for more info on
 * what we mean by java-like iterators.
 *
 * <b>How this class works</b>
 *
 * All run readers are modeled after the iterator concept. So, calling theirs
 * operator*() return the current smalles value inside each of them. Calling
 * theirs operator++ make them advance their reading position.
 *
 * So, instead of putting the values of each run in a priority_queue and
 * recording from which run each value came, we add the run readers
 * (BaseSlidingReader) themselves to the queue. The "head" of the queue will
 * then be the run with the smallest value up that moment. This does need a
 * more elaborate comparison operator for the priority_queue but nothing really
 * difficult - it is quite obvious, really.
 *
 * The whole merging process then can be seen as a sequence of the following
 * steps:
 *
 *  - Poping the head of the queue (run with the smalles triple in this
 *  given moment),
 *
 *  - Saving this triple value and advacing the run's reading position,
 *
 *  - Adding the run reader back to the priority_queue if it non-empty.

/**Simple and na√Øve inverted file writer.
 *
 * All other (?!) index dumpers descend from this one.
 * This one uses no compression at all.
 *
 * This class defines a really simple inverted file writer. As "input" it
 * uses a run merger, from which it will read triples that, in turn, will 
 * be grouped in <em><term, tf, <inverted list>></em> sequences and written
 * to disk.
 *
 * While this class does not implement any kind of index compression, you
 * can subclass it to construct more advanced inverted file writers that
 * do compress the generated inverted lists. See @c dumpInvertedList
 * for more information on how to specialize this class.
 *
 * The basic structure of inverted files created with this class is as follow.
 * There are two or more files for each inverted file:
 *
 * - index.hdr
 *
 *  	The inverted list header, holding the search structure of this inverted
 *  	file. It consists of an array of @c hdr_entry tuples, containing, for
 *  	each term, its <document count (tf), file position, data file number>.
 *  	
 *
 * - index.data_xxxx
 *
 *   	The inverted file data files. Each of such files contain a
 *   	concatanation of various inverted lists.
 *
 * 	On 32bits architeture, files and processes can address at most ~2GB of
 * 	data. There are tricks to get around this limitation but they are way
 * 	too much troublesome for this assignment. For this reason, an index
 * 	file may be splitted in more then one data file.
